        So I know this is weird but what I did was starting on June 24 I wrote a little blog post? journal entry thing for us and what I did that day when I thought about you (all the time) and what we did that day if we hung out. Hopefully this will be a little record that will sit here till the internet dies so you can always come back and remember how much I love you. <br> This also isn't the only thing I did for you. Watch the embedded video please. It's glorious and worthy of praise to a scary degree.

        So today is day one of me taking on this weird project. I wasn't really sure what to do that would be special enough for you, because I normally do special things but I had to make sure for you it's extra special because you're the most special person in the world. I just want you to know how much I care and since I am honestly pretty bad at being honest about it I prefer to show it through gestures and stuff. That's why I like to buy you chocolate or make you a website for your birthday. I am a nerd and idk if you knew just how much. <br> Is anyone else reading this? If so hey. Caitlin? Maybe idk. Feel free to share I guess the link will work for anyone. <br> That's another thing. I wanted this to be public. This isn't something I'm doing just to make you fall for me, this is stuff I know is so true anyone can read it. <br> That's pro0bably enough for today, I donâ€™t need to set a precedent of writing too much or I'll have to live up to that expectation.

        Well it's actually 12:28am June 26 rn but hey I just got off the phone with you. We did that geocaching thing today and its actually super cool. But honestly I probably enjoy it way more just because I'm doing it with you. Like it makes everything better. I wonder if we're still doing it now. Hopefully that monthly membership payed off haha. <br> Man it's late and I'm tired and we're going hiking tomorrow. I do want to take you to Mohonk Tower soon its a super cool hike with a rock scramble I love so we'll have to do that next week I guess. I can't wait for you to come hang out with us camping next week. That should be fun when I force you to play basketball and (maybe) gaga ball with me. Oof am I too old to hurt little children in gaga ball? Probably.

        So we did that horrible hike today. Sorry that sucked, we'll definitely get a better trip in soon. That little "fight" we had if you could call it that was actually super helpful for me bc it let me know kinda how you get angry. Don't stop getting angry at me ok? I need to to keep me in line. <br> So I'm actually super excited Amaya likes me like you don't even know. I just want people who are important to you to like me yk lol. And she's obviously super important to you and I love watching how much you care for her. You're gonna be such an amazing mom. Alex also seemed like he lowkey wanted to hangout with me? Like fishing or smth lol maybe I'm just misinterpreting. I'll totally ask you on our ft tonight and you're gonna read this is August and be like damn he asked about that ahahaha.
