        So I know this is weird but what I did was starting on June 24 I wrote a little blog post? journal entry thing for us and what I did that day when I thought about you (all the time) and what we did that day if we hung out. Hopefully this will be a little record that will sit here till the internet dies so you can always come back and remember how much I love you. <br> This also isn't the only thing I did for you. Watch the embedded video please. It's glorious and worthy of praise to a scary degree.

        <p class="post">
        So today is day one of me taking on this weird project. I wasn't really sure what to do that would be special enough for you, because I normally do special things but I had to make sure for you it's extra special because you're the most special person in the world. I just want you to know how much I care and since I am honestly pretty bad at being honest about it I prefer to show it through gestures and stuff. That's why I like to buy you chocolate or make you a website for your birthday. I am a nerd and idk if you knew just how much. <br> Is anyone else reading this? If so hey. Caitlin? Maybe idk. Feel free to share I guess the link will work for anyone. <br> That's another thing. I wanted this to be public. This isn't something I'm doing just to make you fall for me, this is stuff I know is so true anyone can read it. <br> That's pro0bably enough for today, I don’t need to set a precedent of writing too much or I'll have to live up to that expectation.

        Well it's actually 12:28am June 26 rn but hey I just got off the phone with you. We did that geocaching thing today and its actually super cool. But honestly I probably enjoy it way more just because I'm doing it with you. Like it makes everything better. I wonder if we're still doing it now. Hopefully that monthly membership payed off haha. <br> Man it's late and I'm tired and we're going hiking tomorrow. I do want to take you to Mohonk Tower soon its a super cool hike with a rock scramble I love so we'll have to do that next week I guess. I can't wait for you to come hang out with us camping next week. That should be fun when I force you to play basketball and (maybe) gaga ball with me. Oof am I too old to hurt little children in gaga ball? Probably. 
        </p>

        <p class="post">
        So we did that horrible hike today. Sorry that sucked, we'll definitely get a better trip in soon. That little "fight" we had if you could call it that was actually super helpful for me bc it let me know kinda how you get angry. Don't stop getting angry at me ok? I need to to keep me in line. <br> So I'm actually super excited Amaya likes me like you don't even know. I just want people who are important to you to like me yk lol. And she's obviously super important to you and I love watching how much you care for her. You're gonna be such an amazing mom. Alex also seemed like he lowkey wanted to hangout with me? Like fishing or smth lol maybe I'm just misinterpreting. I'll totally ask you on our ft tonight and you're gonna read this is August and be like damn he asked about that ahahaha.
        </p>

        <p class="post">
        So I may have written this one on Sunday for Saturday but its totally fine it doesn't mean I don't love you... <br> So we went out this morning to TJ Maxx Michaels and Home Depot, it's honestly so cool just going through normal stuff with you. Like just shopping for clothes you don't need is super fun if you shopping with you. I might even try to come meet you today after church tmr. But I might play disc golf ahaha. Anyway today was fun and I'm hoping to get over to the commons soon maybe in the next couple weeks as I get this new job and make freaking BANK. 
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>June 28</h4>
        <p class="post">
        We chilled at my house today so that was nice. I'm sorry I can be weird and I get a little moody with Leah and stuff it's just I get jealous. Shoot me lol. But having you around is so nice. <br> I might not see you for a couple days now so that's gonne be rough. We definitely have to make the most of our time over the summer and then we'll get through the rest of our tiny little roadblcks in the highway that is our relationship. Phenomenal mataphor right ahaha. Love you babe.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>June 29</h4>
        <p class="post">
        So I didn't see you today. :(. I did go to the beach however, and that was fun. I found all those nasty sea creatures. I'm on the phone with you rn and its so nice to just talk to you after not seeing you all day. I can't waut until we can spend all day with each other. <br> I am mildy concerned that these journals are just going to document my mental untraveling ahaha. Like I totally feel inadequate today and I don't really know why and I get that's somewhat irrational but I still feel it. We'll get through it together though, that's the most comforting thought I can have. Anyway I hope you have a great day when you read this! Happy Birthday btw, and I love you.
        </p>

        <p class="post">
        Today we met up in Middletown after your little day trip with Grace. I'm really glad you guys are gatting along its super important to me if we're gonna build a future together. So good job being friendly! <br> I definitely like this denim jacket thing now I just need colder weather to wear it in ahaha. We're on ft rn and the dude just sent you the batman chest hair pic so yeah you're welcome for that memory lol. I only hope someday I can evoke the same response in you he did. I'm gonna sleep now, I love you.

        <p class="post">
        Well today was fairly uneventful we had our weird conversation about faith on ft/text and I feel alot better for some reason. I think it's just the knowing we're gonna figure everyting out with time. When I'm with you I know it's gonna be ok. Anyway that's it for today. 
        </p>

        <p class="post">
        I came over in the evening to watch Phantom of the opera. I really do love how into that stuff you are, it's so cute when you sing along with the music and know random lines ahaha. I really love our time together and I'm never gonna stop saying that. 
        </p>

        Tmr is the Fourth. Very intuitive observation I know. I haven't seen you yet today but I might come over later. You said something about having a bad day at work, hitting your head and feeling anxious. I don't want that for you babe. I wish I could take all your pain and anxiety and experience it for you. But I'll try to do my best in just being there for you babe. I really can't wait until we can spend all our free time together.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4 class="thefourth">July 4</h4>
        <p class="post">
        So I said this yesterday but damn, I really can't wait until we can spend all our time together. Like we were together today for like 9 hours or so and everyting just felt perfect the entire time. Your presence is like this magical spell I just can't experience worry or anyting when I'm around you. I meant what I said about trusting you. I think that's why I love you so much. You make me feel like I'm always supported and you're 100% there for me always, and that's the best feeling ever. I hope I make you feel even close to that good. <br> Just to recap we hiung out at my Nana's house, then went to your house, then to my aunt's, then my house and watched a movie and chilled and ate Chinese, then went to the FARM and chilled and watched fireworks. Definitely one of my best days in a while. What does scare me a little though is I feel like I just had those convos about taking off the fourth like a year ago, and that year already went by, so the summer is defintely going to be gone before we know it. Like we have to do all the crazy random stuff we want to.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>July 5</h4>
        <p class="post">
        SOOOOOOOOOOO, we did a spontaneous Hamilton watching today. Also ran out and grabbed some Mickey D's, went to the park so you could pee, and drove behind the TruValue in PB thinking it had an outlet. Short and sweet today.
        </p>

        <p class="post">
        Well I worked all day, then was gonna come surprise you at work, but I miserad your text and you had left already. OOPS. Well I had a good day. I'm glad we talk all day. Like it's almost bad especially considering we were both at work that we basically had a non stop conversation all day long. Like we didn't even stop to breath. Good thing I love talking to you. I helped the neighbor move in. I do kinda like when you're jealous, it makes me feel like you care and I'm attractive enough that you think other girls will be obsessed with me lol. As crazy as that is. Anyway don't worry. You're the only girl I "have eyes for" as they used to say. And that's gonna be how it is forever.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
        </p>

        We had our little party thing. That actually so cool. I can't wait to host the best parties with you where we're older. Like it's gonna be awesome. Also I do really lake your friends. It's cool being like integrated into the group. I definitely am getting used to it and it's great. I mean obviously they'll all be at our wedding ahaha.

        It's today that I stopped by your job and grabbed you a very large Starbucks drink. We didn't see each other after that but you went to that party, hopefully had a good time, and I had my stressful bike ride to the school. Sometimes I just gotta get out and clear my head. I really just need some time to move on with my life and get my head right yk. It's coming and it will be just us soeday and I'll know then that I have everything I need but rn I'm thinking it all through.

        <p class="post">
        Well today was honestly perfect. we went to church together, spent the whole day together and finished the day together. I just love spending time woth you more than anything. I've probably said that way too many times in the past few days haha. I just got an app so I can edit this website from my phone. It’s super nice and I’ve wanted one of these for a while. I wish I could show you but it might tip you off to the surprise lol. The cool part with this is I’ve done enough days that if I stopped from now till your birthday you’d still have a lot to read. 😂 I wonder how that emoji looks lol.

        oh my gosh. Today was easily the craziest and probably worst experience of my life. Idk what really happened and as I reflect it seems to make more sense. I do love seeing you come closer to God and I never want our journey to him together to stop. I wish I could come to six flags with you tmr but hey, we’ll go another time. 
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>July 14</h4>
        <p class=“post”>
         You went to Six Flags without me. I’m still processing last night. Our relationship is still amazing. I love you. Yeah that’s about it. 
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>July 15</h4>
        <p class=“post”>
So you prayed with me tonight. I don’t really know what to think still. It’s all super confusing. I genuinely hope more than anything that it was genuine for you. I do think that it was. This is the start of a long journey and only time will show both of us how amazing and difficult it will be at times. I always pray for you. 
        </p>

We went to Denardo’s party. Apparently you’re very good at kan-jam. We’re definitely gonna rock some people at that game in the future. There’s something about winning with you that makes me super happy and idk maybe you don’t feel the same way but like yeah. It’s just so great. I really do have to wonder who’s gonna end up reading this lol. 
        </p>

        <p class=“post”>
So you’re graduating tomorrow. That’s so crazy. It’s a whole period of your life that’s just over now. The next part is super exciting but never forget the importance of the experiences you had at Burke. I know I don’t have to tell you that. And also those experiences are going to get less relevant as you get older, but they made you who you are now. That’s an amazing, hardworking smart young woman with an incredible heart and I’m honored to be dating her. I’m really so proud of you and your crazy amount of awards and chords and achievements. I can’t wait to see what you achieve in the rest of your life, raising a family and what you can do for God’s kingdom and whatever ministry he has for us.

CONGRATS YOU GRADUATED!! I also got to hang with you all day so that’s always a plus. You’re currently packing for the beach with Caitlin and trying to pick a bathing suit. I’m doing my best to actually give input but honestly they all look great so 🤷‍♂️. Ur entire butt is definitely not hanging out of that one. I really enjoy getting you flowers and presents and making you feel special because you are special. I’m sorry sometimes I freak you out. I’ve decided not to leave you tho and I promise I won’t. By that I don't mean I thought about leaving, I just have made a decision not to let my weird emotions get in the way of our relationship. We’re in this together for the long haul and I’m excited for everything that comes next.

Well I didn’t get to see you today. You went to the beach and were raped by the sun. I cut down your favorite tree and got the saw stuck then almost had Josh cut off my finger. That’s it. <img src=“photo.jpg”>
        </p>

So I fixed my new chainsaw. Cleaned up the tree I cut down, then went and helped Mr. Olinda load his truck to move. I then went to Middletown to pick up your shelf and lotion for your horrible sunburn. I really am gonna have a weird time going into Target after you leave for school. On that topic I wanna encourage you idk. You’re talking about maybe coming back if you don’t love Loyola or whatever and obviously I want you closer to me but really what I want most is that you’re happy. So if Loyola makes you really happy go for it. But it doesn’t come home and we’ll figure something else out. Also please don’t dye your hair again😂.

WE DID OUR BEACH TRIP. It was a bit underwhelming. I mean between the $50 parking and terrible waves it could have been a lot better. lol you’re in my kitchen rn and that’s funny. You don’t even know what I’m doing but you definitely have suspicions. I’m gonna ask Caitlin about this whole idea tonight lol.
The beach wasn’t great but doing things with you gets me excited for the rest of my like doing things with you. ❤️

Well you are now friends with the girl you thought was your competition😂. So I guess that’s good. You were at my house pretty late which is cool. I really just want you around all the time. Like forever. I’m leaving for jersey tmr and idk what 4 days apart is gonna be like. 
        </p>

I did manage to see you today. Got you a nice lil Starbucks drank and then went on my way. I’m in jersey now and I miss you. Like I didn’t realize what the missing you would feel like but it’s weird. You said something about it not being like I wanna break up miss you but just a missing you thing. And I know what you mean. I miss you but the thought that we’re gonna be together again is enough to keep me going. Not to mention I’m having a good trip so far. Just tired.

We had our beach day with your friends today. I woke up late and I still feel so bad like I’m such an idiot for that. I enjoy hanging out with you so much. Sometimes I’m scared I enjoy it more than you do and that makes me worry but hey, we’ll figure it out. I’m super scared for when you leave for school now. But I know we can make it work. Please make it work. <br> I realized this is like the most commitment I’ve every put into one thing lol. There’s so much here to read. Did you show this to Caitlin? I ran it past her quick the other day and she thinks you’ll like it but hey the amount of time I’ve put in at this point if she said you wouldn’t it would be pretty messed up😂. Now I am starting to wonder if this is a little excessive. Eh oh well.
