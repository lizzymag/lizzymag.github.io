        So I know this is weird but what I did was starting on June 24 I wrote a little blog post? journal entry thing for us and what I did that day when I thought about you (all the time) and what we did that day if we hung out. Hopefully this will be a little record that will sit here till the internet dies so you can always come back and remember how much I love you. <br> This also isn't the only thing I did for you. Watch the embedded video please. It's glorious and worthy of praise to a scary degree.

        So today is day one of me taking on this weird project. I wasn't really sure what to do that would be special enough for you, because I normally do special things but I had to make sure for you it's extra special because you're the most special person in the world. I just want you to know how much I care and since I am honestly pretty bad at being honest about it I prefer to show it through gestures and stuff. That's why I like to buy you chocolate or make you a website for your birthday. I am a nerd and idk if you knew just how much. <br> Is anyone else reading this? If so hey. Caitlin? Maybe idk. Feel free to share I guess the link will work for anyone. <br> That's another thing. I wanted this to be public. This isn't something I'm doing just to make you fall for me, this is stuff I know is so true anyone can read it. <br> That's pro0bably enough for today, I donâ€™t need to set a precedent of writing too much or I'll have to live up to that expectation.

        Well it's actually 12:28am June 26 rn but hey I just got off the phone with you. We did that geocaching thing today and its actually super cool. But honestly I probably enjoy it way more just because I'm doing it with you. Like it makes everything better. I wonder if we're still doing it now. Hopefully that monthly membership payed off haha. <br> Man it's late and I'm tired and we're going hiking tomorrow. I do want to take you to Mohonk Tower soon its a super cool hike with a rock scramble I love so we'll have to do that next week I guess. I can't wait for you to come hang out with us camping next week. That should be fun when I force you to play basketball and (maybe) gaga ball with me. Oof am I too old to hurt little children in gaga ball? Probably.

        So we did that horrible hike today. Sorry that sucked, we'll definitely get a better trip in soon. That little "fight" we had if you could call it that was actually super helpful for me bc it let me know kinda how you get angry. Don't stop getting angry at me ok? I need to to keep me in line. <br> So I'm actually super excited Amaya likes me like you don't even know. I just want people who are important to you to like me yk lol. And she's obviously super important to you and I love watching how much you care for her. You're gonna be such an amazing mom. Alex also seemed like he lowkey wanted to hangout with me? Like fishing or smth lol maybe I'm just misinterpreting. I'll totally ask you on our ft tonight and you're gonna read this is August and be like damn he asked about that ahahaha.

        So I may have written this one on Sunday for Saturday but its totally fine it doesn't mean I don't love you... <br> So we went out this morning to TJ Maxx Michaels and Home Depot, it's honestly so cool just going through normal stuff with you. Like just shopping for clothes you don't need is super fun if you shopping with you. I might even try to come meet you today after church tmr. But I might play disc golf ahaha. Anyway today was fun and I'm hoping to get over to the commons soon maybe in the next couple weeks as I get this new job and make freaking BANK.

        We chilled at my house today so that was nice. I'm sorry I can be weird and I get a little moody with Leah and stuff it's just I get jealous. Shoot me lol. But having you around is so nice. <br> I might not see you for a couple days now so that's gonne be rough. We definitely have to make the most of our time over the summer and then we'll get through the rest of our tiny little roadblcks in the highway that is our relationship. Phenomenal mataphor right ahaha. Love you babe.

        So I didn't see you today. :(. I did go to the beach however, and that was fun. I found all those nasty sea creatures. I'm on the phone with you rn and its so nice to just talk to you after not seeing you all day. I can't waut until we can spend all day with each other. <br> I am mildy concerned that these journals are just going to document my mental untraveling ahaha. Like I totally feel inadequate today and I don't really know why and I get that's somewhat irrational but I still feel it. We'll get through it together though, that's the most comforting thought I can have. Anyway I hope you have a great day when you read this! Happy Birthday btw, and I love you.

So good job being friendly! <br> I definitely like this denim jacket thing now I just need colder weather to wear it in ahaha. We're on ft rn and the dude just sent you the batman chest hair pic so yeah you're welcome for that memory lol. I only hope someday I can evoke the same response in you he did.

        Well today was fairly uneventful we had our weird conversation about faith on ft/text and I feel alot better for some reason. I think it's just the knowing we're gonna figure everyting out with time. When I'm with you I know it's gonna be ok. Anyway that's it for today.

        I came over in the evening to watch Phantom of the opera. I really do love how into that stuff you are, it's so cute when you sing along with the music and know random lines ahaha. I really love our time together and I'm never gonna stop saying that.

        Tmr is the Fourth. Very intuitive observation I know. I haven't seen you yet today but I might come over later. You said something about having a bad day at work, hitting your head and feeling anxious. I don't want that for you babe. I wish I could take all your pain and anxiety and experience it for you. But I'll try to do my best in just being there for you babe. I really can't wait until we can spend all our free time together.

        So I said this yesterday but damn, I really can't wait until we can spend all our time together. Like we were together today for like 9 hours or so and everyting just felt perfect the entire time. Your presence is like this magical spell I just can't experience worry or anyting when I'm around you. I meant what I said about trusting you. I think that's why I love you so much. You make me feel like I'm always supported and you're 100% there for me always, and that's the best feeling ever. I hope I make you feel even close to that good. <br> Just to recap we hiung out at my Nana's house, then went to your house, then to my aunt's, then my house and watched a movie and chilled and ate Chinese, then went to the FARM and chilled and watched fireworks. Definitely one of my best days in a while. What does scare me a little though is I feel like I just had those convos about taking off the fourth like a year ago, and that year already went by, so the summer is defintely going to be gone before we know it. Like we have to do all the crazy random stuff we want to.
