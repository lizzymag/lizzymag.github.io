        So I know this is weird but what I did was starting on June 24 I wrote a little blog post? journal entry thing for us and what I did that day when I thought about you (all the time) and what we did that day if we hung out. Hopefully this will be a little record that will sit here till the internet dies so you can always come back and remember how much I love you. <br> This also isn't the only thing I did for you. Watch the embedded video please. It's glorious and worthy of praise to a scary degree.

        So today is day one of me taking on this weird project. I wasn't really sure what to do that would be special eough for you, becasue I noramlly do special things but I had to make sure for you it's extra special becasue you're the most special person in the world. I just want you to know how much I care and since I am honestly pretty bad at being honest about it I prefer to show it through gestures and stuff. That's why I like to buy you chocolate or make you a website for your birthday. I am a nerd and idk if you knew just how much. <br> Is anyone else reading this? If so hey. Caitlin? Maybe idk. Feel free to share I guess the link will work for anyone. <br> That's another thing. I wanted this to be public. This isn't something I'm doing just to mkae you fall for me, this is stuff I know is so true anyone can read it. <br> That's pro0bably enough for today, I dont need to set a precedent of writing too much or I'll have to live up to that expectation.
